Hello Dr. [LastName],

I noticed [Practice Name] has been recognized for its outstanding patient care—congratulations on that well-deserved reputation! At Sikka, we built OneAPI to make billing, payments, and data insights effortless for busy solo practices like yours.

With our Fee Survey benchmark, you’ll see exactly where you stand on pricing, and with Optimizer, you can automate claims follow-up without another layer of complexity. Our dedicated support team becomes an extension of your practice—so you’re never on your own.

Could we schedule a 15-minute call next week to show you how [Practice Name] can start saving time and increasing collections immediately?
